Truth Discovery Algorithms Experiments 

1. Please run the experiments found in folder ‘TD_experiments’
‘python Experiments_beta.py’
‘python Experiments_gamma.py’
‘python Experiments_uniform.py’
‘python Experiments.py’
 
The environment from which the data is generated is probabilistic and therefore might vary slightly when rerun.

Blockchain Experiments in Ethereum 
The following is how the experiment environment is created and the experiments are run for one set of experiments.

1. Initialise the Ganache private blockchain 
2. Navigate into ethereum_experiements/eth-ganache-setup and deploy the smart contracts to the Ganache blockchain using ‘truffle deploy’.
3. Then navigate back to the ethereum_experiments root folder (where docker-compose.yaml is to be found) and run ‘docker-compose up’
